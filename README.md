This repository contains the implementation and source code related to the referenced research paper. The core objective is to reproduce the customer churn prediction model in the telecommunications industry using **Machine Learning** and **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)** techniques like SHAP and LIME.

The central model, **XAI-Churn TriBoost**, employs an ensemble approach based on XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM to significantly enhance predictive performance and model transparency.
